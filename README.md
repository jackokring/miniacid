# MiniAcid

MiniAcid is a tiny acid groovebox for the M5Stack Cardputer. It runs two squelchy TB-303 style voices plus a punchy TR-808 inspired drum section on the Cardputer's built-in keyboard and screen, so you can noodle basslines and beats anywhere.

## What it does
- Two independent 303 voices with filter/env controls and optional tempo-synced delay
- 16-step sequencers for both acid lines and drums, with quick randomize actions
- Live mutes for every part (two synths + eight drum lanes)
- Pattern and song arrangement system

## Using it

1) Flash `miniacid.ino` to your M5Stack Cardputer ADV (Arduino IDE)
2) Use the keyboard shortcuts below to play, navigate pages, and tweak sounds.  
3) Jam, tweak synths, sequence, randomize, and mute on the fly
